# Server Architecture & Administration Project

For a 3rd year IT engineering school project, we had to setup two **Active Directory** forests in order to create **Group Policies, Rules concerning Passwords or Wallpapers, or even Security issues.** 

Moreover, a **Supervision** setup has to be made, in order to be aware of the provided services' vitality. In order to do so, we used **[CENTREON](centreon.com)** for several reasons, such as the possibility to use a poller, the ease to create dashboards, to add new services or plugins, or even hosts, and we already worked with this server monitoring tool.
